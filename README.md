# Whatever-I-want
Fabric Mod that adds... whatever I wanted
Basically it adds gamerules that changes the gameplay significantly, namely:
1. movementModifier making entities move randomly if they're in mid-air. Higher value means faster.
2. fallDamageMultiplierPercentage: multiply the fall distance by this number in percent. For example, if the gamerule is set to 200, it will multiply the fall distance by two (because 200% is just double the amount).
3. bounceFactorPercent: makes every block bouncy based on Slime Block mechanic! Higher value means they bounce higher compared to default slime block behavior in percent.
